# saptune
The utility adjusts system parameters such as kernel parameters and resource limits
to allow running various SAP solutions at satisfactory performance.
The utility is first made available on SP2 release of SLES4SAP 12, and it can be used in place of [sapconf](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/sapconf). The utility is not yet officially released for ordinary SLES, though it may also function on SLES.

## RPM package
