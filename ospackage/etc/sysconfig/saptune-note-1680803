# You can change the values in this file to values which fit better for your

# You must restart 'tuned' for the changes to take effect.

## Type:    integer
## Default: 0, which means calculating
#
# If the server is a heavily used application server, e.g. a Database, it would
# benefit significantly by using Huge Pages. 
# The default size of Huge Page in SLES is 2 MB, enabling Huge Pages would aid 
# in significant improvements for Memory Intensive Applications/Databases, 
# HPC Machines, this configuration needs to be done if the Applications support
# Huge Pages. If the Applications do not support Huge Pages then configuring 
# Huge Pages would result in wastage of memory as it cannot be used any further
# by the OS. 
#
# By default the used value for huge pages is calculated.
# When set to an integer value(<>0), the kernel parameter "vm.nr_hugepages"
# will be set to this value instead of calculating

# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may 
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput. 
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more 
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher 
# throughput.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the choosen 
# scheduler.
